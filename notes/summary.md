# Summary

The goal was to bring the people producing DL3 data (IACT members) and consuming
DL3 data(science tools writers) together to discuss IACT DL3 data model and
formats, i.e. options and prototypes how to archive, diffuse and consume DL3 data,
and to see if we could work towards a common standard from now on.

It was a two-day face-to-face meeting at the Observatoire de Paris in Meudon
in April 2016, organised by [Catherine Boisson](http://www.iau.org/administration/membership/individual/7665/) and
[Christoph Deil](https://github.com/cdeil).

There were 16 participants from many existing IACTs (HESS, VERITAS, MAGIC, FACT, ASTRI),
and many people from CTA. This was both CTA meeting (see [CTA Indico page](https://www.cta-observatory.org/indico/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=1101)),
but it was open to non-CTA members as well.

TODO: write summary.

For now, the [presentations](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/2016-04_IACT_DL3_Meeting/blob/master/presentations/README.md) slides and  [raw notes](https://github.com/open-gamma-ray-astro/2016-04_IACT_DL3_Meeting/blob/master/notes/raw_notes.pdf) taken collectively during the meeting are available.
